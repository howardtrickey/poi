== Scope

The OGC Points of Interest Conceptual Model Standard (this document) describes a conceptual model for representing information about points of interest (POI).

POI data has many uses including navigation systems, mapping, geocaching, location-based social networking games, and augmented reality browsers.

POI data has traditionally been exchanged in proprietary formats by various transport mechanisms. This document defines a flexible, lightweight, extensible POI data model. This will enable content publishers to effectively describe and efficiently serve and exchange POI data.

To achieve these goals, this document describes a generic data model that may be instantiated in a variety of serializations, including XML, JSON, and RDF. The data model is designed to be extended with POI information specific to the geospatial data it represents.
