== POI Publication Use Case

=== Digitaal Vlaanderen (DV) POI Service

==== Introduction

The **Digitaal Vlaanderen (DV) POI Service** is a strategic initiative that standardizes and publishes location-based information collected by various Flemish government entities. These organizations collect valuable data across sectors such as education, sports, tourism, and public health, which are of great interest to both public institutions and private enterprises. However, the diversity in formats, content, and quality often complicates integration and reuse. The DV POI Service addresses these challenges by aggregating the data, converting it into a unified structure, and publishing it through standardized channels to ensure consistency, quality, and interoperability.

==== Key Statistics of the DV POI Service (2024)

- Over 10 years of continuous service.
- 21 datasets from 8 government agencies.
- Data received in 5 different formats (shp, csv, wfs, xml, json).
- Structured into 8 themes, 17 categories, and 154 POI types.
- More than 199,000 POIs collected for the Flanders region.

By converting heterogeneous data into a harmonized POI data model, Digitaal Vlaanderen improves data accessibility and usability while enabling seamless integration across platforms and systems. This standardization empowers organizations to use reliable, high-quality geospatial data for a wide range of purposes, including urban planning, public service delivery, and emerging applications such as augmented reality (AR), the Internet of Things (IoT), and geospatial analytics—contributing to smarter, more efficient, and data-driven public services.

==== Standardized POI Data Model for Central Storage

A standardized relational POI data model, such as the one established by Digitaal Vlaanderen, is vital to ensuring consistent and accurate representation of POI data from multiple sources. This model translates diverse inputs into a uniform structure that captures essential details such as names, addresses, geographic coordinates, and links to supplementary information. Adopting a standardized model helps streamline integration, supports data quality, and promotes interoperability across platforms and applications. It serves as the foundation for reliable publication, transformation, and reuse of POI data.

==== Implementation Workflow in FME

The POI Service is operationalized through an automated FME (Feature Manipulation Engine) workflow. Key workflow steps include:

- Ingesting source data in supported formats (shp, csv, wfs, xml, json).
- Mapping data to the Digitaal Vlaanderen POI model.
- Enriching and validating geographic coordinates and addresses.
- Encoding records in the OGC-compliant POI JSON format.
- Publishing the final output to target platforms and endpoints.

This robust setup supports large-scale data ingestion from multiple sources, ensuring data consistency, quality, and reusability.

=== Implementation of the OGC POI Conceptual Model

==== Comparing the DV POI Model and the OGC POI Conceptual Model

The **Digitaal Vlaanderen (DV) POI data model** is specifically tailored to the Flemish context, focusing on the structured representation of POIs as collected from regional government organizations. It emphasizes practical usability, data availability, and alignment with local administrative and thematic classifications.

In contrast, the **OGC Points of Interest (POI) Conceptual Model** provides an internationally recognized, abstract framework that defines the core structure, semantics, and relationships needed to represent POIs in a consistent and interoperable way across domains and countries.

While the DV POI model ensures operational efficiency and regional relevance, the OGC model ensures semantic clarity and cross-border interoperability. By aligning the DV POI model with the OGC conceptual model, Digitaal Vlaanderen bridges local implementation needs with global interoperability standards—resulting in a robust, scalable, and internationally compatible POI framework.

==== Translating the DV POI Model into a POI JSON Template

Key implementation steps include:

- Aligning the DV POI model with the OGC conceptual model.
- Generating a reusable POI JSON schema.
- Encoding POIs according to this schema.
- Identifying and resolving transformation issues during encoding.

The encoding process is supported by a modular FME workflow. Each component in the pipeline performs a distinct function, contributing to efficient and reliable POI data publication:

- **Reader**: Loads source data already structured in the DV POI model.
- **Reprojector**: Reprojects spatial data into the WGS84 coordinate system, as required by the OGC standard.
- **Attribute Mapper**: Maps internal field names to the OGC POI Conceptual Model attributes.
- **JSON Templater**: Applies the predefined POI JSON structure, ensuring consistency and completeness.
- **JSON Formatter**: Serializes the structured data into well-formed POI JSON.
- **Writer**: Outputs the final product to the publication platform or endpoint.

This modular design supports batch processing, version control, and incremental updates, making it well-suited for long-term, large-scale data maintenance.
