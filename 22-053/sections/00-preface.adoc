== Abstract

POI-CM is an open conceptual data model for representing information about points of interest (POI). It is defined through a Unified Modeling Language (UML) object model. This UML model extends the ISO Technical Committee 211 (TC211) conceptual model standards for spatial and temporal data. Building on the ISO foundation assures that the features described in the POI Models share the same spatial-temporal universe as described by related standards (e.g., CityGML).

The aim of developing the OGC POI conceptual model is to reach a common definition of the basic entities, attributes, and relations of "points of interest." In the broadest terms, a point of interest is a location about which information of general interest is available. A POI can be as simple as a set of coordinates and an identifier, or more complex such as a three-dimensional model of a building with names in various languages, information about open and closed hours, and a civic address.

This Best Practices Guide provides extended explanations and examples for the individual concepts that are defined in the POI Conceptual Model Standard. Both the Conceptual Model Standard and this Best Practices Guide are mutually linked to facilitate navigation between corresponding sections in these documents.
